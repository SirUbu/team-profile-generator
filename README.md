## Usage
This is a `node` application. Node must be installed in order to run this application. See [Credits](#credits) for information on installing `node`. <br><br> This is a terminal prompt application. You must use the terminal to evoke and run this application. <br><br> Follow these steps to use this application: <br><br> 1. In the terminal and repository main directory evoke `node index.js` <br> 2. You will be met with a prompt to enter information about your team manager. <br> 3. Once you finish entering the manager information, you will be met with a menu to select to either: <br> - *Add an Engineer* to add information for an engineer, <br> - *Add an Intern* to add information for an intern, <br> - *Finish Team* to exit the prompts and generate the HTML and CSS page. <br> 4. Until you select *Finish Team*, you will continue to return to the menu to select to add another team member or finish the team. <br> 5. Once you select *Finish Team*, the console will alert you that the HTML file was generated using the provided information and the CSS file was copied. These will be available in the `dist/` directory. <br> If there was an error, the console will alert you to it.

## Tests
This application uses `jest.js` to run the tests suites (see [Credits](#credits) for more info on `jest.js`) <br><br> Once you have installed the applicaiton (see [Installation](#installation)), you can envoke the test suites through the terminal. <br><br> There are four test suites: <br><br> 1. Employee.test <br> 2. Engineer.test <br> 3. Intern.test <br> 4. Manager.test <br><br> Each test is designed to ensure that the respective object is created with the appropriate properties and methods returning expected data. <br><br> To run the tests, in the terminal envoke `npm test`. To envoke a specific test suite, envoke `npm run test (name)` where (name) is the suite (Employee, Engineer, Intern, or Manager). <br><br> See this link for a walk-through of the tests of this application: [Tests Walk-Through](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YOUybGvxIEf-ee5TPoX6Wd0F8HZMtCQx/view)
